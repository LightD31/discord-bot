"""Past editions' donation curves, for comparing this year against last.

The community project publishes a per-edition metrics file on its object
storage — a cumulative donation curve sampled every ten minutes. That is
static once an edition is over, and it is served from a cache bucket rather
than the API server, so reading it costs the project essentially nothing.

Editions are aligned on **day of the marathon and time of day**, not on raw
elapsed time. Donations follow the clock: evenings peak, nights go quiet. The
honest question is "where were we last year on the second evening at 21:00",
and a weekday reads better than "after 53 hours".

Coverage varies by edition, so nothing may be assumed about it. The 2024 file
is an exact recording — it starts and ends on that edition's fundraising
window to the minute, and its final value matches the API total. The 2025 file
is truncated at both ends: it opens eight hours late at 164 452 € already
raised and stops nearly three hours early, 480 000 € short of the API total.
Anything below a curve's floor therefore has no knowable crossing time and is
reported as unknown rather than guessed.

Pure parsing and arithmetic — the fetch lives in ``extensions/zevent/api.py``.
